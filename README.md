# Social-Learning-Strategies

TODO:
1. Assumptions
1.1 time delay for only social learners because they are informed from the previous time step
1.2. Recursion not included (i.e. social learners are not informed from their own decision from previous time steps)
1.3. 


2. Add mutation to differential equations

3. Implement all social strategies (i.e. CopyRandom, CopyMajority ...)

4. Environment change

5. Complete all analysis of graphs for different parameters and initial conditions for 2-armed behavior case


6. Extend behaviors to n-armed

7. Perform same on n-armed case analysis done in 2-armed case
