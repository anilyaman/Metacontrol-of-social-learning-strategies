# Meta-control of social learning strategies

The code includes the Matlab implementation and analysis of the learning processes in populations of individuals using individual learning, conformist and success based social learning strategies. Performed an analysis on the learning processes using two approaches: agent based modeling using evolutionary algorithms, and a mathematical model using replicator-mutator equation. Furthermore, we provide the implementation of the meta-control approach to switch between different strategies based on the perceived uncertainty of the environment.
